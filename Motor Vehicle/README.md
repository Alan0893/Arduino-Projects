# Motor Vehicle
**Arduino Project #3 - Motor Vehicle**

## Objective
Make a vehicle that is able of maneuvering through a pretermined track. 

**Part 1 of the Race:**
Autonomous mode:  In this mode your vehicle will have 15 seconds to get as far as possible through the track on its own(through programming).  

**Part 2 of the Race:**
TeleOp Mode:  In this mode your vehicle should be programmed to follow a light.  You or your partner will use the flashlight from one of your cellphones to lead the vehicle through the track.  (~3 minutes. If vehicle does not make progress, time will stop)
